		<p>Hello, and welcome to my personal in-progress career-building website. Here you will find helpful resources such as my resume to learn my talents and abilities as a software developer. As a software engineering student, my progression in programming can be quite erratic. Over time, this site will in fact update and expand to reflect my increasing experience in using HTML and CSS to build a website that not only displays necessary information, but satisfies the user. After all, deploying software is, at its core, a <i>user-driven experience.</i></p>
