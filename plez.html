          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">The Ultimate IOU</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">Consider a Friday Night In with all of your friends. Everyone is hungry, but not everyone has their wallets on them. So you, being the Good (Hungry) Samaritan you are, take it upon yourself to order a pizza for the whole party. Unfortunately,
            you forget the price. And can't trace it. But by God, if you take a slice you owe a slice. So how do you get around this dilemma? You could arbitrarily ask everyone for direct payment, but not everyone wants to engage in some sort of Pizza
            Slice Economy where you need to track receipts, have equalize the price between pizza joints, and above all else have the money ready and present. So your sketchy friend in the corner, bright little bulb they are, comes up with an idea. You
            will pay them, and they will teach you a secret handshake only you should know, redeemable for one pizza slice. Not everyone is good at the cryptographic complexities lying behind a secret handshake, but you trust your friend. So people pay
            them, learn a handshake for every payment (~almost equivalent to a slice of pizza) and then, when the munchies set in, they approach you and teach you the handshake, promising to forget it. You can then verify it through your sketchy friend,
            who will tacitly nod, now wearing shady sunglasses, and tell you you can redeem it through him to get your money back. Now, of course, nothing is free, and every dealing with your shady, shade-wearing, book-keeping friend costs a small transaction
            fee.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">Perhaps this seems burdensome? But in reality, it frees you from the confines of needing physical money, and wherever your shady...friend may show up, you can easily trade a handshake for a slice of pizza. Go ahead, try it. Anywhere. But not
            China. Because, well, it's China, y'know?</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">Soon other bookies hear word, and they start making their own secret handshakes, and securing the sanctity of the seemingly-sketchy system by verifying each other's codes on transaction. But things get out of hand. Handshakes are no longer for
            pizzas, they're for phones, TVs, cars, houses, yachts....and pretty soon somebody comes up with a bright idea. I can simply trade my way through handshakes, screw over my friends that started trying to earn pizzas, and ILL. BE. RICH.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">...probably</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">But everyone catches wind of these exploits, so they grow tentative about buying handshakes. Certain sketchy friends are trusted less because less people walk away owning the white-picket-fence of their dreams. Yet the trade continues. People
            gamble. Some idiots still just want a free-form way to pay for pizza. Yet the sketchy friends continue to make their smart little codes, and continue to reap the gains of small transaction fees. And somewhere, out there, someone who once just
            wanted a slice of pizza, is now either wildly desititute or rich beyond imagination. In far fewer places is there someone who actually just wants to make an earnest exchange. The power of the word of mouth.</p>

        <a><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-chevron-down" style="color: black" aria-hidden="true"data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#ddosBlurb"></span></a>
        <div id="ddosBlurb" class="collapse">
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">
            Approach any stat nerd you know, and ask them about the Birthday Paradox. ....you don't know any stats nerds? For shame.</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">But the basic idea is this: get a room full of people, and ask them one by one for their birth date. If you want to make it interesting, place a bet that 2 people will have the same birthday.</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">If you're joined by one or two people, you may fall in the red. You may find yourself saying its your birthdate, if you're scummy. But by the time you're joined by 23 people, you have a 50-50 chance of pocketing money. By the time you're joined
            by 70 people, the chance is at 99.9%; easy money.</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">Most people may see this, understand some form of probability, and think, "but 70/365 is, like 20%. What the hell is going on??" Enter Pidhgenholes; an idea in discrete mathematics that I'm going to summarise in the simplest way. A terrible
            Pidgeon-owner is trying to put his poor birds away into their, and does so by...well...randomly chucking them at holes. If a hole is clear, the bird will stick the landing. Otherwise, pidgeon-on-pideon collisions are imminent. As the holes
            fill, the likelihood goes up. The same can be said for our birthdays being ticked off the calendar.</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">In mathematic terms, your password is a series of those holes. Someone can check all posssible combinations, then move on. Don't worry, your passwords are mostly safe; they consist of combinations that would be endless...fields of pidgeons.
            But lately in the news we've heard the phrase, DDoS attack.</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">This is the counter-response to having tons of possible combinations; the bad guys link up, join forces, and unleash pidgeon-throwing armageddon. Okay, they really just try formulae until things begin to click into place. But the faster they
            can discover breaches, the faster they accelerate the process, until someone is finally inside your precious Facebook account.
          </p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">Get it? If not, please ask. But how can we possibly counter this offensive?? The solutions are fairly simple.</p>
          <p class="blurb" style="color: #233237; font-weight: bold;">First, you can use ciphers with a minimum of 128-bits; while this will make your processes take longer, it will make using a birthday attack far, far less practical. You can also limit how long the parts are exposed by limiting TLS sessions
            to 64 bits. A lot of these processes involve simply abandoning any Triple-DES Cipher functionality still used by your website, or basically, "upgrade your servers".
